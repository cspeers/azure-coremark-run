# azure-coremark-run

## What
A powershell hack-job converting the original [ACU (Azure Compute Unit)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/acu) run for the [CoreMark](https://github.com/eembc/coremark) benchmark.  It should generate CSV

## Why
The old one was a bunch of scripts from a time seemingly pre-dating CoreMark going OSS that is now too hard to find anyway.

## Where
Ubuntu

run the script directly, via cloud-init, etc.
